FooCoding Repository

FooCoding repository is created for my full stack web development course/program offered by FooCoding based in Malmo Sweden. This intensive 6-month course exposes me with the hand-on projects and prepares me well to take on role as full stack developer after finishing the course. 

Below are some topics discussed:
1. HTML5/CSS3/CLI
2. JavaScript/GIT/Debugging
3. Node.JS, Express
4. Database MySQL Cli
5. React

Before successfully completing this course, I am required to complete final project which is part of real working experience in typical software company.
