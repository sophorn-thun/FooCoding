I created this resume using HTML and CSS. Below is some learning strategies I used to get the final output:

1. Review materials of HTML and CSS from two popular knowledge sharing sites:
  - CSS-trick.com: This site provided me with really well-explained topics on CSS especially on Flexbox and Grid.
  - MDN Web Docs: This site provided me with simple and easy-to-follow HTML tags, semantic HTML and ARIA.

2. YouTube Video:
  - Some topics are hard to understand by just reading especially the technical ones. So I searched the topics on YouTube. This channel created by Kevin Powell is really good and helps me to better understand Flexbox and Grid.

3. Classmates: I asked for help from classmates/seniors from the class to explain when I could not find solution by myself.
